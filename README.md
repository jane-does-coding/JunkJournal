# About me Website

This website is a website to show my work and tell people some more about me.

Something I struggled with, when making this website was creating a book/journal animation, because the turned page would disappear, but I fixed it by messing with parent element's classes

## Tech stack

I used framer motion, Nextjs, tailwindcss, and Javascript for this website
